# 🔍 Image Similarity Search Model  

This repository contains a deep learning-based image retrieval system that takes an image as input and finds the most similar images from a given dataset. This is useful for applications like content-based image retrieval (CBIR), product recommendations, and visual search engines.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Deep Learning-based Feature Extraction**: Uses CNN models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet) to generate feature vectors.  
- **Fast & Scalable Retrieval**: Utilizes cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or FAISS for efficient image matching.  
- **Customizable Dataset**: Works with any image dataset, making it adaptable to various applications.  
- **Easy Integration**: Provides a simple API or script for seamless deployment.  

## 📌 How It Works  
1. **Preprocessing**: The input image is resized and normalized.  
2. **Feature Extraction**: A pre-trained CNN extracts meaningful features from the image.  
3. **Similarity Search**: The model compares extracted features with the dataset and retrieves the most similar images.  

## 🛠 Installation  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-similarity-model.git
cd image-similarity-model
